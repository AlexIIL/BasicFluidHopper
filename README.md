# Basic Fluid Hopper #

The Fluid Hopper is similar to a hopper, but it moves fluids (using the Fabric Fluid Transport API). A mod with fluid tanks (such as Large Fluid Tank) is recommended.

A minecart version of the Fluid Hopper is also included.

**Some things you can do with a Fluid Hopper:**

* Drain source fluid blocks from the world
* Add or remove fluids from cauldrons to collect lava or continuously fill water bottles
* Add or remove fluids from fluid tanks
* Transport or distribute fluids by rail
* Use a bucket to add or remove fluids from a Fluid Hopper (and minecart)

**Planned features:**

* Adding lava directly to furnaces for easy fuel distribution
* Interactions with droppers/dispensers to fill buckets/bottles when activated
* Extracting honey from beehives

**Compatibility with other mods:**

This mod should mostly work with modded fluids. Bucket interactions currently only support water and lava, but that will change when there's a good mod to test with.
